### Pre-requisites

Before running this application, you should need the following programs installed:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) (v8.10 or higher)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

Also, as optional I would recommend to install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) (dependency manager) but you could use `npm` as well, which is installed with `nodejs`.

### How to run?

1. Install dependencies by running the following command in your trusted command-line:bash

```bash
yarn
```

or

```bash
npm install
```

2. To start the server:

```bash
yarn start
```

or

```bash
npm run start
```

### How to run tests?

After completing step #1:

```bash
yarn test
```

or

```bash
npm run test
```

##### Coverage

```bash
yarn test:coverage
```

or

```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

After running this command, you could see the coverage HTML generated in the folder "coverage" at root level of the project.
